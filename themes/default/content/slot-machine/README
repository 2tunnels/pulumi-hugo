# Slot machine page generation

This page is generated with the Go program in the `generate` subdirectory based
on the code examples in the nested `examples` subdirectory. The name of each file
must be of the form `{language}-{cloud}-{app}.{extension}`, and the contents will
be added to the page.

To regenerate the `_index.md` file, run the following command from this directory:

```bash
go run generate/main.go
```
