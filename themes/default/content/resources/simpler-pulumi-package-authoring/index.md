  description: >-
    Let’s explore how to start sharing Pulumi code with others. We’ll
    use Go to build a custom architecture for GCP that we’ll then compile down
    into a library we can share with others who work in other languages.


    If you want to code along, you’ll need a [free Pulumi SaaS account](https://app.pulumi.com/signup/), [the Pulumi CLI](https://www.pulumi.com/docs/get-started/install/), [Go](https://www.pulumi.com/docs/intro/languages/go/), and a Google Cloud account (free tier is okay).
