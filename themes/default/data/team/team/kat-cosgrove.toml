bio = """
Kat Cosgrove is a Developer Advocate, a CNCF Ambassador, and an actual cyborg. Her professional background
has run the gamut from bartender, to video store clerk, to teacher, to software engineer. She credits this
wide-ranging experience for her success as a speaker, developer, and advocate. You can usually find her
speaking about DevOps or cloud native technologies, particularly 101-level content, in pursuit of her goal
of increasing accessibility for these tools.

When sheâ€™s not building demos or at a conference, she spends her time playing video games, watching horror
movies, and reading science fiction. She lives in Seattle with her cat, Espresso, who is the real brains
behind the operation. Espresso may be ghostwriting her tweets.
